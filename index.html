      <h1>About Jude</h1>
      <p>
        Jude Richardson, is a piano graduate of the USA’s Jacobs School of
        Music, now performing and teaching regularly in the Leicestershire area.
        Born in Bermuda, his upbringing exposed him to Afro-American spirituals
        and hymns. He also was captivated by classical music after being gifted
        music CDs by family friends. Fascinated by music and performing, Jude
        began to teach himself piano, and by age 13, had mastered difficult
        works including Chopin’s Fantasie Impromptu. <br />
        <br />
        After playing the Fantasie Impromptu for ex-jazz trumpeter and piano
        tuner Carl Shechtman, Mr. Schechtman connected Jude with arts nonprofits
        and scholarship programmes who provided the funding for him to begin
        taking piano lessons at the Bermuda School of Music, where he earned his
        Grade 8 Piano ABRSM. Later, the Bermuda arts community generously
        provided funding for him to study music in Denver, Colorado, with
        world-class pianist Alice Rybak and at the Jacobs School of Music, with
        competition-winning pianist Evelyne Brancart. Upon starting his studies
        at the prestigious music school, he was awarded a full scholarship, the
        David & Barbara Jacobs Scholarship to support his studies. <br />
        <br />
        Throughout his studies, Jude has performed regularly in Bermuda and the
        USA, having played at important music showcases including Bermuda’s
        Premier’s Concerts (2014 & 2017), Indiana University’s Summer Piano
        Academy (2014-2018), and provided music for countless events,
        fundraisers, and private recitals. His sister Eden studied Biological
        Sciences at the University of Leicester and she was a member of the
        University of Leicester Chorus. When Jude decided to come to Leicester,
        Eden contacted Paul Jenkins, retired UoL chemistry professor and active
        conductor and musician, to ask if he could find some opportunities for a
        pianist. Since then Jude has been piano soloist with the UoL symphony
        orchestra, provided accompaniment to the University Chorus and worked
        with student vocalists. He also performed Grieg’s Piano Concerto in A
        minor in June with the Rugby Rococo Players with Dr. Jenkins as
        conductor and continues to regularly perform at the Attenborough Arts
        Centre. He is scheduled to perform Beethoven’s Emperor Concerto with the
        Leicester Symphony Orchestra on 3 March 2024 in De Montfort Hall. In
        addition to performing, Jude teaches piano lessons from the Bishop
        Street Methodist Church and has an Instagram account, jrichardsonpiano,
        where he provides information on upcoming performances and lessons.

      <h1>About Jude</h1>
      <p>
        Born in Bermuda, Jude’s early musical upbringing was in Afro-American spirituals and
hymns, but as a boy he became captivated by classical music after being gifted music
CDs by family friends. Fascinated by music and performing, Jude began to teach
himself the piano, and by age 13 he was playing a wide variety of advanced
repertoire. After hearing Jude play Chopin’s challenging Fantasie Impromptu, ex-jazz
trumpeter and piano technician Carl Shechtman sought support for Jude through arts
non-profits and scholarship programmes, securing funding for him to begin taking
formal piano lessons at the Bermuda School of Music.
Thanks to the generosity of the Bermuda arts community, Jude was fortunate to go
on to study music in Denver USA with professional pianist and professor Alice Rybak,
who prepared him for university music auditions. He won the David &amp; Barbara Jacobs
Scholarship at the prestigious Jacobs School of Music, which further supported his
studies with international
competition-winning pianist Evelyne
Brancart. Jude performed widely in
Bermuda and the USA, including at
Bermuda’s Premier’s Concerts (2014
&amp; 2017), for Indiana University’s
Summer Piano Academy (2014-
2018), and in countless other
recitals, events and fundraisers.
Arriving in Leicester in 2022, Jude
has performed as soloist with the
University of Leicester Symphony
Orchestra under the baton of Dr. Paul Jenkins, acted as accompanist to the University
Chorus, and worked with student vocalists. He performed Grieg’s Piano Concerto in A
minor in June 2023 with the Rugby Rococo Players, and last year performed
Beethoven’s Emperor Concerto with the Leicester Symphony Orchestra under Dexter
Drown at De Montfort Hall. In addition to performing, Jude writes his own music and
teaches piano both privately and in schools around the county.
